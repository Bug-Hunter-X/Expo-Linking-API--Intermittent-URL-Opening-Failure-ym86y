# Expo Linking API Intermittent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo `Linking` API where URLs fail to open reliably in an external browser.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to debug due to the lack of informative error messages.

## Bug Description

The `Linking.openURL` function sometimes fails to open the provided URL.  There are no errors logged to the console, making it hard to identify the root cause.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project using Expo Go.
3. Repeatedly tap the button to open a URL.  Notice that the URL occasionally fails to open.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling and potentially using a fallback mechanism. The provided solution checks the promise returned by `Linking.openURL` for success. If it fails, a user-friendly error message will be displayed.
